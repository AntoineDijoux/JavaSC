# JavaSC
Implements a caching function and a deadline scheduler.

Foreword:
- Those are my very first steps into Java. I picked up and learnt as I was going through the assignment.
- Though I tried my best to follow Java coding best practices, the reviewer might find coding style derived from C#.
- The deadline scheduler might look bit over engineered. As I was learning about Java, I wanted to experiment further with multithreading, data structures, bitwise operations and so forth. In all fairness I believe I maintained a decent level of readability.
