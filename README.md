# JavaSC
Coding challenge, implementation a caching function and a deadline scheduler. The challenge instructions are given as the interfaces DeadlineEngine.java and Cache.java.

Foreword:
- Those are my very first steps into Java. I picked up and learnt as I was going through the assignment.
- Though I tried my best to follow Java coding best practices, the reviewer might find coding style derived from C#.
- The deadline scheduler might look bit over engineered. As I was learning about Java, I wanted to experiment further with multithreading, data structures, bitwise operations and so forth. In all fairness I believe I maintained a decent level of readability.
- Henceforth, this is my first git repository for a Java project. If it is not easy to clone, kindly let me know so I can correct.

Technical:
- Developped with Intellij
- Java 16.0.2
- Notes on the implementation and algorithm will be found in the code's comments.
